Your code looks solid. More commenting is always helpful.

In terms of keeping it more in line with the UNIX philosophy, you may want to make your code more generic. By doing that, it can be more applicable and modular.

For instance, right now your code takes a student's name and replaces his grade. You may want to just adjust the code so that it works as a find and replace function for any string, not just in the context of student's grades.
